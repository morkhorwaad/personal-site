**Professionally**, I have a wide array of experience. After my B.S. in Software Engineering, I worked (mostly) as a Full Stack Developer, so I'm comfortable anywhere.

For the last four years or so, I stepped away from the office to find a way to connect with my _community_. I worked at the [Brownsville Butcher & Pantry](https://www.butcherandpantry.com/) doing everything under the sun: Social Media Marketing, Graphic Design, Web Design, Project Management, Event Coordination, Data Analytics, and Beverage Management. It was intense, and gratifying, and I gradually became a pillar in my own community; something I've always wanted. 

Recently, I have been getting the urge to get back into a technical role, and I am specifically interested in data science. I have a strong background in logic, programming, database management, and most recently Google Sheets &mdash; all of which, along with my professional experience, I'm looking forward to bringing into a new role. To cut my teeth, I'm working through [DataCamp's Data Analyst with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-python) course, [reading through Tufte](https://www.amazon.com/Books-Edward-R-Tufte/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AEdward+R.+Tufte), and bringing that knowledge to bear in some data-viz projects.  

If you're interested in poking around my code, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/morkhorwaad), and any projects that can stand on their own I'll write about here. You can download [my resume](/downloads/mark_harwood_resume.pdf) as well; if you have any other questions, feel free to <a href="/contact" class="internal-link">reach out</a>.

**Personally?** I'm an avid hiker, skiier, and mountain biker &mdash; I moved back to Vermont to have access to all three. In 2022 I got certified as a sommelier (WSET L2 in Wines), and I'm just as passionate about craft coffee. When I travel, it's always based around where we're going to eat. 


## The site? 
I wrote this site in [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) back in 2019. It's hosted with [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/), and you can view the source [here](https://github.com/morkhorwaad/personal-site). It's pretty straightforward React, and the blog articles and project pages are all done in Markdown - I wrote <a href="/blog/making-my-site" class="internal-link">an article</a> about it if you want to know more. 

**2024 Update:** As I'm looking to get back into a technical role, I need a more dynamic site to show off what I can do. Projects will be coming first, but afterwards I'll be looking at React & Friends (or Vue?) hosted on Vercel.
