**Professionally**, I'm a software developer. I generally lean toward web development and design, but I'm just as comfortable in the back end. The difficulty is that I'm fascinated by everything in the software lifecycle: from developer (DevOps, automation), to client (management, consultation), to end user (accessibility, design) &mdash; all on top of sound architecture, clean code, and scalability. 

The phrase "jack of all trades, master of none" comes to mind. I'm working on getting better at pinning down focus. 

If you're interested in poking around my code, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/morkhorwaad), and any projects that can stand on their own I'll write about here. You can download [my resume](/downloads/mark_harwood_resume.pdf) as well; if you have any other questions, feel free to <a href="/contact" class="internal-link">reach out</a>.

**Personally**, I'm a lot of things, but some of my biggest interests are rock climbing, cooking, and generally slowing down just a little bit. 



## The site? 
I wrote this site in [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), host it with [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/), and you can view the source [here](https://github.com/morkhorwaad/personal-site). It's pretty straightforward React, and the blog articles and project pages are all done in Markdown - I wrote <a href="/blog/making-my-site" class="internal-link">an article</a> about it if you want to know more. 

It's a work in progress, and probably always will be &mdash; that's the fun part!
