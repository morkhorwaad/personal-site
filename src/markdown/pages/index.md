If you're looking for a helping hand with a website, updating and/or formalizing your brand, or maybe just some solid advice, I would be happy to talk. Check out my <a href="/projects" class="internal-link">portfolio</a>, and <a href="/contact" class="internal-link">drop a line</a> when you're ready. 

For those who got here from my LinkedIn, Indeed, or [resume](/downloads/mark_harwood_resume.pdf) &mdash; hello! I am actively job-huting, with a particular interest in pivoting toward a data-centric role. I am working on some data visualization projects _right now_, and will be posting the results & code here when they're done. 

As of 2024, <a href="/blog/making-my-site" class="internal-link">this current website</a> is old! When my portfolio is in place, I will be rewriting it to be more dynamic. 

Make yourself at home.
