The first product I build &mdash; that actually went live &mdash; was the website for SPACE. Full disclosure, this is a project I undertook for [my mom, Alice](https://aliceharwood.com) and was done with love pro bono (duh). 

To briefly outline the course of the project, I: 

- Worked with Alice to workshop and define core requirements for the site, and learned about her existing attendees
- Acquired all relevant pre-existing assets, including logos, pictures, email lists, and copy
- Mocked up layouts, reviewed and iterated on them, and finally implemented them as a Wix site
- Set up donations, email, and events
- Walked Alice through the processes of sending an email, creating an event, and editing text and images herself
- Deployed a website for SPACE!

## The request
Alice needed a website for her nonprofit organization SPACE, Inc &mdash; which, if you're wondering, is an acronym for _Spiritual, Practical, Artistic, Creative Education_. 

When she came to me with this request, the first thing I did was start up a shared document to brainstorm what she needed, wanted, and already had. We also came up with ideas on brand identity, customer personas, and some growth opportunities once the initial site was up. 

The core functionality requirements were straightforward: 

1. Inform visitors about what SPACE was, and why it existed;
2. Have a place to view upcoming events, and a way to book appointments; 
3. Be able to accept donations;
4. Link to other relevant sites, including [Alice's site](/projects/a-website-for-alice) and social media.

The organization was pre-existing, and had accumulated a list of event attendees/interested parties, so another soft ask was to have some way to integrate some email capability into the site. 

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the final product needed to be something that Alice (or one of her friends) could have a dummyproof way of updating in the future; new events, emails, and copy, would need to be added eventually.


## Deciding on Wix

I knew immediately that this would be built using a website generator &mdash; it would be the safest way to ensure that Alice could maintain the site after I had handed over the keys. There are a lot of blog articles that exist already on the pros and cons of different services, so I won't get into that decision here, but we ended up going with [Wix](https://wix.com). 

This was an important decision because it didn't just make the site future-proof, it also answered two of my initial questions: 

- How are events going to be created/stored/viewable? 
- How will emails be sent and managed? 

While there may be better tools that answer these questions, SPACE is not a large-scale operation, and the out-of-the-box solutions provided by website building platforms are perfectly adequate. Expanding into third-party solutions like MailChimp or Eventbrite is relatively straightforward, so there is a path forward if need be. 

## Design 
With Wix decided on, the design was straightforward to start working with. Alice wanted to get _something_ up pretty quickly, so a lot of the design we let the base theme decide for us. 

Even with the base UI elements constructed, there was still the layout to construct, and modifications to ensure that we were staying consistent with the SPACE brand and values that we identified. 

### Website Layout
When the project was being discussed, I wanted to learn about the types of people attending SPACE events to inform the layout design. The very low-tech research technique of 'just asking Alice about the type of person coming through' made it clear that her attendees were generally on the older side of the spectrum, and less inclined to be online. 

This was relevant because I had all sorts of [extreme ideas in my head](https://hoverstat.es), and was quickly brought back down to earth realizing that it would have to be as friendly and understandable as possible. 

I had initially started using [balsamiq](https://balsqmiq.com) to put together pages, but realized that even that was unnecessary given the mostly static nature of the site. After switching to pen and paper, some designs were quickly agreed upon for the flow. 

The structure ended up being five actual pages: 

- A landing page, with a description of the two unchanging, monthly events, and a contact form at the bottom
- An about page, with links to 'friend' and 'sister' sites
- A page for upcoming events
- A page for bookable services
- A donation page

Wix event and services modules took care of the page structure for the individual events/services booking pages, which made the rest easy to implement.
